I am an enthusiastic Front-end & WordPress Developer with an eye for the small details. My focus is on building fast, reliable and user-friendly websites that stand out ðŸ”¥
In addition to the Front-end & WordPress, I like to deal with all aspects of a project. I like to immerse myself in the world of UX & UI design, setting up the workflow as efficiently as possible and keeping my code as clean as possible. I also love servers, marketing strategies and the continuous improvement of my developments.
